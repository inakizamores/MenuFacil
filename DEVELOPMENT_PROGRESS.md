# MenuFacil Development Progress

## Project Overview
MenuFácil is a web-based application designed to help restaurants digitize their menus with QR codes. It provides a simple way for restaurant owners to create, manage, and update their digital menus, while offering customers an easy way to view menus on their mobile devices.

**Current Version:** 0.3.0 (Architecture Restructuring)  
**Repository:** Private GitHub repository  
**Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router  

## UI Design Principles

| Design Principle    | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Modern & Interactive** | The landing page and hero section feature animations and hover effects for an engaging experience. Optimized for performance to ensure smooth loading on all devices. |
| **Dashboard & B2B UX** | Clean, professional, and easy to use. Subtle animations keep it modern without distraction. Uses rounded corners, frosted glass, and shadows to create hierarchy and separation. |
| **Adaptive Responsive Design** | Admin dashboard and management interfaces are desktop-optimized but scale to mobile devices; customer-facing menu views are mobile-first |
| **Color & Gradients** | Follows the defined color palette. Gradients are more prominent on the landing page, while the dashboard keeps them minimal for clarity. |
| **Hierarchy & Shadows** | Shadows are used to separate elements like headers and footers, improving structure and readability. |
| **Published Menu Customization** | Restaurant owners can personalize their public menus with different fonts and colors while maintaining readability and usability. |
| **Simplicity & Accessibility** | The interface is intuitive, with big, readable buttons and minimal complexity. Actions are easy to perform without unnecessary steps. |
| **Inspired by SaaS & Big Tech** | Design takes inspiration from modern software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, ensuring a sleek and contemporary feel. |
