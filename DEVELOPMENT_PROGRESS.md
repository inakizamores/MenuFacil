# MenuFácil Development Progress

## Project Overview
MenuFácil is a web-based application designed to help restaurants digitize their menus with QR codes. It provides a simple way for restaurant owners to create, manage, and update their digital menus, while offering customers an easy way to view menus on their mobile devices.

**Project Start Date:** March 14, 2024  
**Current Version:** 0.3.0 (Architecture Restructuring)  
**Repository:** Private GitHub repository  
**Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router  
**Last Updated:** July 15, 2024

## Recent Implementations

We've improved the QR code management functionality with the following enhancements:

1. **Form Validation**
   - Implemented Zod schema validation for QR code creation and editing forms
   - Added comprehensive validation for all QR code properties (name, design options, table numbers, etc.)
   - Integrated form validation with React Hook Form for a better user experience

2. **User Interface Improvements**
   - Enhanced the QR code editor with a more intuitive layout
   - Added real-time preview of QR code changes
   - Improved color selection interface with color picker support

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added better error handling for form submissions
   - Implemented user-friendly error messages
   - Improved feedback for successful operations

4. **Code Quality**
   - Ensured consistent TypeScript typing across components
   - Fixed type compatibility issues between form values and server action parameters
   - Improved reusability of QR code form components

5. **Deployment Fixes**
   - Simplified the `createQRCode` server action to resolve type compatibility issues
   - Fixed import paths for form components to use the proper case-sensitive paths
   - Successfully deployed to Vercel with zero TypeScript errors

## Handover Documentation

### Code Organization
All components follow these organization principles:
1. **Imports** at the top, organized by:
   - React and Next.js dependencies
   - Third-party libraries
   - Project-specific components and utilities
   
2. **Type Definitions** (interfaces, types)
   - Component props with descriptive JSDoc comments
   - Utility types needed for the component
   
3. **Component Structure**
   - Consistent function component syntax
   - State definitions with appropriate initial values
   - Effect hooks with clear dependency arrays
   - Clearly named handler functions
   - Return statement with well-organized JSX

4. **Comments**
   - JSDoc comments for component definitions
   - Inline comments for complex logic
   - TODO comments for future improvements

### Current Working Areas
1. **QR Code Management**
   - The QR code editor and generator have been updated with proper form validation
   - Batch generation functionality is working but can benefit from performance optimizations
   - Export functionality offers multiple formats (PNG, SVG, PDF) successfully

2. **Form Validation**
   - Zod schemas have been implemented for all major forms
   - Integration with React Hook Form is functioning correctly
   - Error handling and user feedback are working as expected

### Known Issues
1. **Type Compatibility**
   - Some TypeScript errors still exist in QR code form validation implementation
   - The UUID type casting needs to be addressed in owner_id fields
   
2. **Performance**
   - Large batches of QR codes may cause performance issues
   - Some form validations could benefit from debouncing for a smoother experience

### Pending Tasks
1. **User Settings Panel**
   - This is the next major feature to be implemented
   - Should include profile management, notification settings, and theme preferences
   - Requires integration with Supabase auth for user profile updates

2. **Menu Analytics Enhancement**
   - The analytics dashboard needs more interactive visualizations
   - Export functionality for analytics data is required
   - Time-based filtering would improve the analysis capabilities

### Instructions for Next Developer
1. **Setup**
   - Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are up to date
   - Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example` with your Supabase credentials
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

2. **Recommended Next Steps**
   - Prioritize the remaining TypeScript errors in QR code validation
   - Begin work on the user settings panel according to the specifications
   - Implement the unit tests for critical components

3. **Useful Resources**
   - Refer to `lib/validation/schemas.ts` for examples of Zod validation schemas
   - Check `app/components/ui/form.tsx` for reusable form components
   - See `app/components/qr-code/management/QRCodeEditor.tsx` for form validation integration examples

This handover document should provide a clear understanding of the current state of the project and what needs to be addressed next. All future updates should be documented in this DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md file to maintain a centralized record of development progress.
