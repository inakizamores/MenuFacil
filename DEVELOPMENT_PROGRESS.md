   - Corrected import paths for form components to use the proper case-sensitive paths

3. **Results**
   - Successfully deployed to Vercel with zero TypeScript errors
   - Maintained full QR code generation functionality while simplifying the API surface
   - Documented the temporary compromise for future reimplementation

4. **Future Improvements**
   - Plan to reimplement full Zod validation with proper typing once core features are stable
   - Will refactor the form handling to use a more consistent API across components
   - Will add proper type safety with stricter checks for required parameters

### QR Code Form Validation (July 12-13, 2024)
We've successfully implemented Zod validation for QR code forms in the application with the following components:

1. **Validation Schema**
   - Created a comprehensive `qrCodeSchema` in `lib/validation/schemas.ts`
   - Implemented validation for required fields (name), optional fields (description, table number), and activation status
   - Added validation for QR code design properties with appropriate constraints:
     - Hex color validation for foreground and background colors
     - Numeric validation for margin (0-4) and corner radius (0-50)
     - URL validation for optional logo references

2. **Form Components**
   - Developed reusable form components in `app/components/ui/form.tsx`
   - Created necessary UI components including Textarea, Switch, and Form layout components
   - Integrated with React Hook Form and Zod resolver for seamless validation

3. **QR Code Generator Enhancement**
   - Updated the QRCodeGenerator component to use the new validation schema
   - Improved error handling with clear validation messages
   - Enhanced UX with real-time validation and improved form structure

4. **Server Action Integration**
   - Modified `createQRCode` to handle both legacy and schema-validated form data
   - Implemented proper type handling for nested form fields

5. **Known Issues**
   - TypeScript errors related to type mismatches between QRCodeFormValues and createQRCode parameters
   - These issues need to be addressed in a future update to ensure type compatibility

   - Ensure consistent behavior between creation and editing forms
   - Handle edge cases for existing data validation

4. **Technical Debt Resolution**
   - Address the owner_id UUID type casting issue more systematically
   - Consider creating a utility function for ID type conversion
   - Review and fix any remaining TypeScript errors
   - Update any outdated import paths for consistency

All validation implementations should follow the established pattern in `lib/validation/schemas.ts` and use the Zod schema pattern with the custom useZodForm hook.

## July 12, 2024
### Implementing Zod Validation for Menu Item Forms
- Created a comprehensive Zod schema for menu item validation (`menuItemSchema`) in `lib/validation/schemas.ts`
- Implemented validation for required fields including name, price, and available status
- Added support for optional fields like description and nutritional information
- Enhanced error messages with clear descriptions of validation requirements
- Integrated the schema with React Hook Form for client-side validation
- Improved UI feedback for validation errors

### QR Code Generation Form Validation
- Created a robust Zod schema for QR code validation (`qrCodeSchema`) in `lib/validation/schemas.ts`
- Implemented comprehensive validation for:
  - Required name field with minimum length requirements
  - Optional description and table number fields
  - Active status toggling for QR codes
  - Custom design properties with appropriate constraints:
    - Hex color validation for foreground and background colors
    - Numeric bounds for margin sizes and corner radius values
    - URL validation for optional logo URLs
- Created reusable Form components in `app/components/ui/form.tsx` to provide a consistent form experience
- Enhanced the QRCodeGenerator component to use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Updated the createQRCode server action to handle the validated form data
- Improved error handling and user feedback throughout the QR code generation process

**Note on Deployment Issues**: TypeScript errors related to mismatched types for QRCodeDesignProps and createQRCode parameters are preventing deployment. These issues need to be resolved in a future update by ensuring type compatibility between the QRCodeFormValues and the server action parameters.
