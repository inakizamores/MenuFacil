# MenuFacil Development Progress

## Project Overview
MenuFácil is a web-based application designed to help restaurants digitize their menus with QR codes. It provides a simple way for restaurant owners to create, manage, and update their digital menus, while offering customers an easy way to view menus on their mobile devices.

**Current Version:** 0.3.0 (Architecture Restructuring)  
**Repository:** Private GitHub repository  
**Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router  

## UI Design Principles

| Design Principle    | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Modern & Interactive** | The landing page and hero section feature animations and hover effects for an engaging experience. Optimized for performance to ensure smooth loading on all devices. |
| **Dashboard & B2B UX** | Clean, professional, and easy to use. Subtle animations keep it modern without distraction. Uses rounded corners, frosted glass, and shadows to create hierarchy and separation. |
| **Adaptive Responsive Design** | Admin dashboard and management interfaces are desktop-optimized but scale to mobile devices; customer-facing menu views are mobile-first |
| **Color & Gradients** | Follows the defined color palette. Gradients are more prominent on the landing page, while the dashboard keeps them minimal for clarity. |
| **Hierarchy & Shadows** | Shadows are used to separate elements like headers and footers, improving structure and readability. |
| **Published Menu Customization** | Restaurant owners can personalize their public menus with different fonts and colors while maintaining readability and usability. |
| **Simplicity & Accessibility** | The interface is intuitive, with big, readable buttons and minimal complexity. Actions are easy to perform without unnecessary steps. |
| **Inspired by SaaS & Big Tech** | Design takes inspiration from modern software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, ensuring a sleek and contemporary feel. |

#### Enhanced API Security & Authentication System

1. **Comprehensive Registration API Implementation**
   - Created a new `/api/auth/register` endpoint with integrated security features
   - Implemented schema validation using Zod for strong request validation
   - Added rate limiting to prevent abuse and brute force attacks (3 attempts per hour)
   - Incorporated comprehensive error handling with appropriate status codes
   - Implemented detailed error logging to database for security monitoring
   - Created user profiles in database after successful Supabase Auth registration
   - Added IP-based and email-based rate limiting for enhanced security
   - Structured error responses with consistent format for better client integration

2. **Authentication API Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive API documentation in `docs/API_AUTHENTICATION.md`
   - Documented all endpoints with request/response examples
   - Added security considerations and best practices
   - Included client-side implementation examples
   - Documented rate limiting policies and error handling approaches

3. **Error Handling System**
   - Implemented a centralized error handling system in `lib/api/error-handler.ts`
   - Created a database logging system for all API errors
   - Added error categorization with standardized error types
   - Implemented unique request IDs for error correlation
   - Enhanced security by concealing sensitive error information in production
   - Created specialized error handlers for common error scenarios (auth, validation, etc.)

4. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
   - Created a flexible rate limiting system in `lib/api/rate-limiter.ts`
   - Implemented different rate limit configurations for various auth endpoints
   - Added IP-based rate limiting with custom key generators
   - Created specialized configurations for login, registration, and password reset
   - Implemented proper rate limit headers in responses
   - Added cleanup mechanisms to prevent memory leaks

#### Known Issues and Limitations

1. **TypeScript Integration with Supabase**
   - The Supabase client has some typing issues with the profiles table
   - Currently using a `@ts-ignore` comment to suppress the error
   - A future update should improve the type definitions or use a different approach

2. **In-Memory Rate Limiting**
   - Current rate limiting uses an in-memory Map which doesn't persist across serverless invocations
   - For production scalability, this should be replaced with Redis or similar persistent storage
   - Added comments in the code documenting this limitation

#### Next Steps and Future Improvements

1. **Immediate (Next Session)**
   - Implement password reset API route with similar security features
   - Complete the email verification flow with proper error handling
   - Add more comprehensive validation for the registration form (password strength indicators, etc.)

2. **Short-term (This Sprint)**
   - Replace in-memory rate limiting with a persistent solution (Redis recommended)
   - Add proper CSRF protection to all authentication endpoints
   - Enhance error logging with more contextual information
   - Create an admin interface for viewing and managing error logs

3. **Medium-term (Next Sprint)**
   - Implement account lockout after multiple failed attempts
   - Add two-factor authentication support
   - Create a user session management interface
   - Implement suspicious activity detection and alerting
   - Add proper event logging for all authentication activities

### Handover Notes for Next Developer/AI Agent

#### Current Status Summary
The authentication system has been significantly enhanced with a secure registration API route, comprehensive error handling system, and rate limiting. All changes are documented in code comments and in the API documentation.

#### Immediate Next Steps (Highest Priority)
1. **Password Reset Implementation**
   - Create a `/api/auth/reset-password` endpoint with similar security features as login/register
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Add comprehensive error handling and validation
   - Document the API in the authentication documentation

2. **Email Verification Flow**
   - Enhance the registration flow with proper email verification handling
   - Create a verification success/failure page
   - Implement proper redirects after verification
   - Enhance error handling for invalid or expired verification links

3. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
   - Create comprehensive tests for the authentication API
   - Test edge cases for the rate limiting system
   - Verify error logging works correctly in production

#### Technical Debt to Address
1. **Supabase Client Typing Issues**
   - Fix the typing issues with the profiles table in the Supabase client
   - Update database.types.ts and supabase.types.ts to ensure proper type checking
   - Remove the @ts-ignore comment from the registration route

2. **Rate Limiting Persistence**
   - Research and implement a Redis-based rate limiting solution
   - Update the rate-limiter.ts file to use the persistent storage
   - Add proper configuration for connecting to Redis

Remember to continue documenting all changes in this file to ensure smooth handovers between development sessions.
