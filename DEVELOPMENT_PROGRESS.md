# MenuFacil Development Progress

## Project Overview
MenuFácil is a web-based application designed to help restaurants digitize their menus with QR codes. It provides a simple way for restaurant owners to create, manage, and update their digital menus, while offering customers an easy way to view menus on their mobile devices.

**Current Version:** 0.3.0 (Architecture Restructuring)  
**Repository:** Private GitHub repository  
**Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router  

## UI Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Consistent Light Theme** | Clean, professional appearance with simplified UI development |
| **Adaptive Responsive Design** | Admin dashboard and management interfaces are desktop-optimized but scale to mobile devices; customer-facing menu views are mobile-first |
| **Brand Consistency** | Primary UI colors aligned with MenuFácil brand identity |
| **Accessibility** | Light theme with high contrast for optimal readability |

| **Context API** | Global state management (authentication state) |
| **Custom Hooks** | Form handling, validation, and data fetching |
| **Server Components** | Performance-optimized rendering where applicable |
| **Responsive Design** | Desktop-first for admin, mobile-first for customer views |
| **Repository Pattern** | Database access with Supabase |

   - Added detailed responsive design strategy table
   - Updated feature completion status
   - Added planned tasks for the next sprint

### Code Changes Made
- Enhanced `auth-context.tsx` with improved session initialization and cleanup
- Updated `lib/supabase/client.ts` for better cookie handling
- Added debug logs to trace authentication flow
- Added user change detection in dashboard components
- Implemented state reset mechanisms for clean user switching
- Added timeout before navigation to ensure state updates complete

### Next Steps
For the next developer or AI agent, prioritize these tasks:

1. **Immediate (Next Session)**
   - Implement URL structure for public menus following `menufacil.app/menu/{restaurantName}` pattern
   - This requires updating Next.js routes in the `app` directory
   - Ensure QR codes generate links with the new URL structure

2. **Short-term (This Sprint)**
   - Apply enhanced form validation to remaining forms (login, registration, menu creation)
   - Create form controls for complex data types (arrays, nested objects)
   - Continue improving error handling for network requests and form submissions

3. **Testing Required**
   - Verify authentication flow works consistently across different browsers
   - Test user switching between accounts with different roles
   - Validate dashboard properly refreshes with new user data

### Known Issues
- Some components may need additional error handling for edge cases
- Dependencies have punycode deprecation warnings that should be addressed soon
- Need to verify compatibility with the latest Supabase client updates

Remember to document all changes in this file at the end of each development session to ensure smooth handover between developers or AI agents.
