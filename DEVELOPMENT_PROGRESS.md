# MenuFácil Development Progress

## Project Overview
MenuFácil is a web-based application designed to help restaurants digitize their menus with QR codes. It provides a simple way for restaurant owners to create, manage, and update their digital menus, while offering customers an easy way to view menus on their mobile devices.

**Project Start Date:** March 14, 2024  
**Current Version:** 0.3.0 (Architecture Restructuring)  
**Repository:** Private GitHub repository  
**Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router  
**Last Updated:** July 21, 2024

## UI Design Principles

The MenuFácil application follows these key design principles:

1. **Consistent Light Theme** - The application uses a consistent light theme throughout to ensure a clean, professional appearance and simplify UI development. This design decision eliminates the complexity of supporting dark mode and multiple theme options.

2. **Mobile-First Approach** - All interfaces are designed with mobile users in mind, then scaled up for larger screens.

3. **Brand Consistency** - Primary UI colors align with the MenuFácil brand identity.

4. **Accessibility** - The light theme with high contrast ensures good readability for all users.

## Recent Implementations

### Enhanced QR Code Management (July 15, 2024)
We've improved the QR code management functionality with the following enhancements:

1. **Form Validation**
   - Implemented Zod schema validation for QR code creation and editing forms
   - Added comprehensive validation for all QR code properties (name, design options, table numbers, etc.)
   - Integrated form validation with React Hook Form for a better user experience

2. **User Interface Improvements**
   - Enhanced the QR code editor with a more intuitive layout
   - Added real-time preview of QR code changes
   - Improved color selection interface with color picker support

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added better error handling for form submissions
   - Implemented user-friendly error messages
   - Improved feedback for successful operations

4. **Code Quality**
   - Ensured consistent TypeScript typing across components
   - Fixed type compatibility issues between form values and server action parameters
   - Improved reusability of QR code form components

5. **Deployment Fixes**
   - Simplified the `createQRCode` server action to resolve type compatibility issues
   - Fixed import paths for form components to use the proper case-sensitive paths
   - Successfully deployed to Vercel with zero TypeScript errors
