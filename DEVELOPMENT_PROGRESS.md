# MenuFácil Development Progress

## Project Overview
MenuFácil is a web-based application designed to help restaurants digitize their menus with QR codes. It provides a simple way for restaurant owners to create, manage, and update their digital menus, while offering customers an easy way to view menus on their mobile devices.

**Project Start Date:** March 14, 2024  
**Current Version:** 0.3.0 (Architecture Restructuring)  
**Repository:** Private GitHub repository  
**Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router  
**Last Updated:** June 20, 2024

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React 18.2.0, Next.js 14.1.0
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Type System:** TypeScript 5.3.3
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 3.4.1, with custom UI component library
- **API Architecture:** Serverless with Next.js API Routes
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with JWT
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage for images and assets
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Production/Preview)
- **Analytics:** Posthog (planned)
- **Payments:** Stripe (planned)
- **Form Handling:** Custom form hook with validation
- **Testing:** Jest (planned), Cypress (planned)

### Key Design Patterns
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Reusable UI components with clear separation of concerns
- **Context API:** For global state management (authentication state)
- **Custom Hooks:** For form handling, validation, and data fetching
- **Server Components:** For performance-optimized rendering where applicable
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Repository Pattern:** For database access with Supabase
- **Facade Pattern:** For service abstraction
- **Atomic Design Principles:** For UI component organization

```

## Database Schema
The database is hosted on Supabase and follows this relational structure:

```
users
└── profiles
    └── restaurants
        └── menus
            ├── menu_categories
            │   └── menu_items
            │       └── menu_item_variants
            └── qr_codes
```

Key table relationships:
- One-to-many: Users → Restaurants → Menus → Categories → Items
- One-to-many: Items → Variants
- One-to-many: Menus → QR Codes

Database features:
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Indexed columns for query performance
- Timestamped records (created_at, updated_at)
- JSON fields for flexible data storage (e.g., nutritional_info)

## Development Approach
We're using a structured, incremental development approach, focusing on delivering core functionality first and then expanding to more advanced features. We're implementing best practices in web development, including:

- **Type-Safety:** TypeScript for type safety with strict mode enabled
- **Modern React Patterns:** Functional components, hooks, and context
- **Server-Side Rendering:** Next.js 14 for SSR, ISR, and optimized routing
- **Database Management:** Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
- **Consistent Styling:** TailwindCSS for consistent and responsive styling
- **Form Management:** Custom form validation hooks for enhanced user experience
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach for seamless experience on all devices
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Accessibility:** ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Internationalization:** Support for multiple languages (planned)

## Development Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Authentication State Management
**Problem:** Maintaining authentication state across pages and handling session expiration.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented a comprehensive auth context with Supabase event listeners
- Created useAuth hook for easy access to auth state
- Added session refresh mechanisms with token expiry handling
- Implemented protected route middleware with proper redirect handling

**Code Solution:**
```typescript
// Using AuthProvider with event listeners
const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, session) => {
  setSession(session);
  setUser(session?.user ?? null);
  setIsLoading(false);
});
```

### Challenge: Complex Form Handling
**Problem:** Managing form state, validation, and submission for complex forms with many fields.

**Solution:**
- Created a custom `useForm` hook that handles form state, validation, and submission
- Implemented field-level validation with custom rules
- Added touched state tracking for better UX
- Created reusable validation functions

**Code Solution:**
```typescript
// Example validation setup
validationSchema: {
  name: (value) => validate.required(value, 'Item name is required'),
  price: (value) => {
    if (value === undefined || value === null) return 'Price is required';
    if (value < 0) return 'Price cannot be negative';
    return null;
  }
}
```

### Challenge: TypeScript Integration with Supabase
**Problem:** Ensuring type safety with Supabase responses and database operations.

**Solution:**
- Created thorough TypeScript definitions for database tables
- Implemented typed helper functions for database operations
- Used generic types for query responses
- Added runtime validation with Zod schemas

**Code Solution:**
```typescript
// Typed database operations
export async function getMenuItem(id: string): Promise<{ data: MenuItem | null; error: string | null }> {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('menu_items')
      .select('*')
      .eq('id', id)
      .single();
      
    // Type checking and transformation
    return { data: data ? mapDatabaseMenuItem(data) : null, error: error?.message || null };
  } catch (error) {
    return { data: null, error: 'Failed to fetch menu item' };
  }
}
```

### Challenge: Import Path Inconsistency
**Problem:** Inconsistent import paths caused component failures and developer confusion.

**Solution:**
- Standardized all import paths with @/ prefix
- Updated tsconfig.json with path aliases
- Refactored all imports throughout the codebase
- Created import sorting standards

**Code Solution:**
```json
// tsconfig.json path configuration
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Challenge: Responsive Design
**Problem:** Creating a consistent user experience across devices of all sizes.

**Solution:**
- Implemented a mobile-first design approach
- Used TailwindCSS breakpoints for responsive layouts
- Created adaptive components that adjust to screen size
- Used containerQueries for component-level responsiveness

**Code Solution:**
```tsx
// Responsive component example
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  {items.map(item => (
    <MenuItemCard key={item.id} item={item} />
  ))}
</div>
```

### Challenge: File Upload Implementation
**Problem:** Creating a reliable file upload system with preview and progress.

**Solution:**
- Built a reusable FileUpload component
- Implemented drag-and-drop functionality
- Added upload progress tracking
- Created proper error handling for uploads
- Added preview capabilities

**Code Solution:**
```tsx
// FileUpload component usage
<FileUpload 
  onFileSelected={handleImageUpload}
  accept="image/*"
  maxSizeInMB={5}
  isLoading={isUploading}
  progress={uploadProgress}
  preview={values.imageUrl}
/>
```
