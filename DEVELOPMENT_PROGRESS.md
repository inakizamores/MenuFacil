# MenuFácil Development Progress

## Project Overview
MenuFácil is a web-based application designed to help restaurants digitize their menus with QR codes. It provides a simple way for restaurant owners to create, manage, and update their digital menus, while offering customers an easy way to view menus on their mobile devices.

**Project Start Date:** March 14, 2024  
**Current Version:** 0.3.0 (Architecture Restructuring)  
**Repository:** Private GitHub repository  
**Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router  
**Last Updated:** June 20, 2024

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React 18.2.0, Next.js 14.1.0
- **State Management:** React Context API
- **Type System:** TypeScript 5.3.3
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 3.4.1, with custom UI component library
- **API Architecture:** Serverless with Next.js API Routes
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with JWT
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage for images and assets
- **Deployment:** Vercel (Production/Preview)
- **Analytics:** Posthog (planned)
- **Payments:** Stripe (planned)
- **Form Handling:** Custom form hook with validation
- **Testing:** Jest (planned), Cypress (planned)

### Key Design Patterns
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Reusable UI components with clear separation of concerns
- **Context API:** For global state management (authentication state)
- **Custom Hooks:** For form handling, validation, and data fetching
- **Server Components:** For performance-optimized rendering where applicable
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Repository Pattern:** For database access with Supabase
- **Facade Pattern:** For service abstraction
- **Atomic Design Principles:** For UI component organization

## Database Schema
The database is hosted on Supabase and follows this relational structure:

```
users
└── profiles
    └── restaurants
        └── menus
            ├── menu_categories
            │   └── menu_items
            │       └── menu_item_variants
            └── qr_codes
```

Key table relationships:
- One-to-many: Users → Restaurants → Menus → Categories → Items
- One-to-many: Items → Variants
- One-to-many: Menus → QR Codes

Database features:
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Indexed columns for query performance
- Timestamped records (created_at, updated_at)
- JSON fields for flexible data storage (e.g., nutritional_info)

## Development Approach
We're using a structured, incremental development approach, focusing on delivering core functionality first and then expanding to more advanced features. We're implementing best practices in web development, including:

- **Type-Safety:** TypeScript for type safety with strict mode enabled
- **Modern React Patterns:** Functional components, hooks, and context
- **Server-Side Rendering:** Next.js 14 for SSR, ISR, and optimized routing
- **Database Management:** Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
- **Consistent Styling:** TailwindCSS for consistent and responsive styling
- **Form Management:** Custom form validation hooks for enhanced user experience
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach for seamless experience on all devices
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Accessibility:** ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Internationalization:** Support for multiple languages (planned)

## Development Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Authentication State Management
**Problem:** Maintaining authentication state across pages and handling session expiration.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented a comprehensive auth context with Supabase event listeners
- Created useAuth hook for easy access to auth state
- Added session refresh mechanisms with token expiry handling
- Implemented protected route middleware with proper redirect handling

**Code Solution:**
```typescript
// Using AuthProvider with event listeners
const { data: { subscription } } = supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange((_event, session) => {
  setSession(session);
  setUser(session?.user ?? null);
  setIsLoading(false);
});
```

### Challenge: Complex Form Handling
**Problem:** Managing form state, validation, and submission for complex forms with many fields.

**Solution:**
- Created a custom `useForm` hook that handles form state, validation, and submission
- Implemented field-level validation with custom rules
- Added touched state tracking for better UX
- Created reusable validation functions

**Code Solution:**
```typescript
// Example validation setup
validationSchema: {
  name: (value) => validate.required(value, 'Item name is required'),
  price: (value) => {
    if (value === undefined || value === null) return 'Price is required';
    if (value < 0) return 'Price cannot be negative';
    return null;
  }
}
```

### Challenge: TypeScript Integration with Supabase
**Problem:** Ensuring type safety with Supabase responses and database operations.

**Solution:**
- Created thorough TypeScript definitions for database tables
- Implemented typed helper functions for database operations
- Used generic types for query responses
- Added runtime validation with Zod schemas

**Code Solution:**
```typescript
// Typed database operations
export async function getMenuItem(id: string): Promise<{ data: MenuItem | null; error: string | null }> {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('menu_items')
      .select('*')
      .eq('id', id)
      .single();
      
    // Type checking and transformation
    return { data: data ? mapDatabaseMenuItem(data) : null, error: error?.message || null };
  } catch (error) {
    return { data: null, error: 'Failed to fetch menu item' };
  }
}
```

### Challenge: Import Path Inconsistency
**Problem:** Inconsistent import paths caused component failures and developer confusion.

**Solution:**
- Standardized all import paths with @/ prefix
- Updated tsconfig.json with path aliases
- Refactored all imports throughout the codebase
- Created import sorting standards

**Code Solution:**
```json
// tsconfig.json path configuration
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Challenge: Responsive Design
**Problem:** Creating a consistent user experience across devices of all sizes.

**Solution:**
- Implemented a mobile-first design approach
- Used TailwindCSS breakpoints for responsive layouts
- Created adaptive components that adjust to screen size
- Used containerQueries for component-level responsiveness

**Code Solution:**
```tsx
// Responsive component example
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  {items.map(item => (
    <MenuItemCard key={item.id} item={item} />
  ))}
</div>
```

### Challenge: File Upload Implementation
**Problem:** Creating a reliable file upload system with preview and progress.

**Solution:**
- Built a reusable FileUpload component
- Implemented drag-and-drop functionality
- Added upload progress tracking
- Created proper error handling for uploads
- Added preview capabilities

**Code Solution:**
```tsx
// FileUpload component usage
<FileUpload 
  onFileSelected={handleImageUpload}
  accept="image/*"
  maxSizeInMB={5}
  isLoading={isUploading}
  progress={uploadProgress}
  preview={values.imageUrl}
/>
```

## For New Developers

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
2. Set up local environment variables (see .env.example)
3. Start the development server
4. Review the project documentation in /docs

### Key Areas to Understand
1. Project structure and code organization
2. Authentication and authorization model
3. Form handling and validation patterns
4. UI component system and styling approach
5. Data fetching and state management

### Common Pitfalls
1. Forgetting to handle loading and error states
2. Not following the established naming conventions
3. Using direct DOM manipulation instead of React patterns
4. Not handling edge cases in form validation
5. Ignoring TypeScript type safety

### Best Practices
1. Follow the established folder structure
2. Use the custom hooks for common patterns
3. Write unit tests for new functionality
4. Document complex components and functions
5. Maintain type safety throughout

## Conclusion
MenuFácil has a solid foundation with core features implemented to a high standard. The upcoming work focuses on completing the menu item management system, implementing QR code generation, and developing the public-facing menu experience. Maintaining code quality, improving test coverage, and enhancing documentation should be ongoing priorities alongside feature development.
