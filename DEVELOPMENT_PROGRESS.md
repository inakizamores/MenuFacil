# MenuFácil Development Progress

## Project Overview
MenuFácil is a web-based application designed to help restaurants digitize their menus with QR codes. It provides a simple way for restaurant owners to create, manage, and update their digital menus, while offering customers an easy way to view menus on their mobile devices.

**Project Start Date:** March 14, 2024  
**Current Version:** 0.3.0 (Architecture Restructuring)  
**Repository:** Private GitHub repository  
**Framework:** Next.js 14 with App Router  
**Last Updated:** June 24, 2024

## Project Architecture

### Technology Stack

## Database Schema
The database is hosted on Supabase and follows this relational structure:

```
users
└── profiles
    └── restaurants
        └── menus
            ├── menu_categories
            │   └── menu_items
            │       └── menu_item_variants
            └── qr_codes
```

Key table relationships:
- One-to-many: Users → Restaurants → Menus → Categories → Items
- One-to-many: Items → Variants
- One-to-many: Menus → QR Codes

Database features:
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Indexed columns for query performance
- Timestamped records (created_at, updated_at)
- JSON fields for flexible data storage (e.g., nutritional_info)

## Development Approach
We're using a structured, incremental development approach, focusing on delivering core functionality first and then expanding to more advanced features. We're implementing best practices in web development, including:

- **Type-Safety:** TypeScript for type safety with strict mode enabled
- **Modern React Patterns:** Functional components, hooks, and context
- **Server-Side Rendering:** Next.js 14 for SSR, ISR, and optimized routing
- **Database Management:** Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
- **Consistent Styling:** TailwindCSS for consistent and responsive styling
- **Form Management:** Custom form validation hooks for enhanced user experience
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling throughout the application
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach for seamless experience on all devices
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Core functionality works without JavaScript
- **Accessibility:** ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Internationalization:** Support for multiple languages (planned)

## Recent Feature Implementations

### Vercel Deployment Fixes (June 2024)
When deploying to Vercel, we encountered client-reference-manifest errors caused by nested route structures. We implemented the following fixes:

1. **Middleware Improvements**
   - Converted `middleware.js` to `middleware.ts` with proper TypeScript typing
   - Enhanced route handling for marketing routes to prevent conflicts
   - Added redirects for problematic route patterns like `(marketing)` and `(routes)/(marketing)`

2. **Route Mapping**
   - Created comprehensive `routes.js` file mapping all application routes
   - Organized routes by category (marketing, auth, dashboard, etc.)
   - Helped Vercel identify all routes during build process

3. **Static Generation Configuration**
   - Added `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` to marketing pages
   - Added appropriate revalidation periods for pages with data requirements

4. **Route Structure Simplification**
   - Removed problematic nested route groups (particularly `app/(routes)/(marketing)`)
   - Created simple root-level marketing pages (`/app/about/page.tsx`, `/app/contact/page.tsx`)
   - Avoided issues with nested route groups causing client reference manifest errors

These changes resolved the deployment issues, and the application is now successfully deployed to Vercel at: https://menufacil-apv8pgzdp-inakizamores-projects.vercel.app

### QR Code Export System (May 2024)
We implemented a comprehensive system for exporting QR codes in multiple formats:

### Analytics Dashboard Implementation (June 2024)
We've implemented a comprehensive analytics dashboard to provide restaurant owners with insights into how their digital menus are performing:

1. **Dashboard Features**
   - **Overview Page**: Shows key metrics like total views, mobile views, and most common traffic sources
   - **Device Breakdown**: Visual representation of views by device type (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - **Traffic Sources**: Analysis of how customers are accessing menus (direct, scan, share)
   - **Time-based Analysis**: Charts showing views over time to identify trends and patterns

2. **Visualizations**
   - **Line Charts**: For tracking views over time
   - **Pie Charts**: For device distribution
   - **Bar Charts**: For source breakdown
   - **Progress Bars**: For visual comparisons

3. **Backend Implementation**
   - Server actions to retrieve analytics data from Supabase
   - Functions for aggregating and formatting metrics
   - Type-safe interfaces for all analytics data

4. **Technical Improvements**
   - Fixed ref callback functions in QR Code components for better memory management
   - Improved error handling in analytics-related components
   - Added support for restaurant-specific analytics filtering

The analytics dashboard is accessible from the main navigation and provides restaurant owners with valuable insights to help them optimize their digital menu performance.

Key files:
- `app/(routes)/dashboard/analytics/page.tsx` - Main analytics dashboard
- `actions/analytics.ts` - Server actions for retrieving analytics data
- `app/utils/analytics.ts` - Utilities for tracking and processing analytics events
