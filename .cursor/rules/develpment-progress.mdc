# MenuFácil Development Progress

## Project Status
The MenuFácil project is currently in active development. The backend is mostly functional, and we're implementing and refining frontend features.

## Recently Completed Features
- Implemented menu publishing workflow with PublishMenu component
- Added improved error handling and success notifications to the `ItemCategorizer` component
- Enhanced the `ItemCategorizer` component with drag-and-drop functionality using `@dnd-kit/core`
- Implemented a visual preview of dragged items using `DragOverlay`
- Standardized image property naming across menu item forms
- Fixed authentication context issues by properly exporting `AuthContext` and using `React.createElement` in `.ts` files
- Standardized environment variable documentation in `.env.example`
- Fixed TypeScript errors throughout the codebase

## In Progress
- Improving error handling for network requests and form submissions
- Enhancing user interface components for better usability
- Implementing comprehensive client-side validation for all forms

## Planned Improvements

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. ~~Enhance `ItemCategorizer` with drag-and-drop functionality using `@dnd-kit/core`~~ ✅
2. ~~Add error handling and success notifications to components~~ ✅ (Started with ItemCategorizer)
3. ~~Complete the menu publishing workflow~~ ✅
4. Implement comprehensive client-side validation for all forms

### Medium-term
1. Refactor authentication to use a single, consistent implementation
2. Implement image optimization for uploaded menu item images
3. Add support for multi-language menus
4. Improve accessibility across all UI components

### Long-term
1. Implement analytics tracking for menu views and interactions
2. Create a mobile app version using React Native
3. Add support for online ordering integration
4. Implement real-time menu updates using WebSockets

## Technical Debt
- Multiple similar `AuthContext` implementations exist in different locations
- Some components lack proper error handling for edge cases
- Need for more comprehensive test coverage
- UI components could benefit from better accessibility features

## Dependencies
- Next.js 14.0.4
- React 18
- Supabase for authentication and data storage
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
