When successfully completed implementing a new feature or fixing a significant issue, without me explicitly asking, you should:

1. GitHub Synchronization:
   - Create a meaningful commit message summarizing the changes
   - Automatically commit all changes to the GitHub repository
   - Push the changes to the main branch (or the currently active branch)

2. Vercel Deployment:
   - Add/update any required environment variables to the Vercel project
   - Trigger a new production deployment using Vercel CLI or API
   - Verify the deployment was successful by checking the deployment logs and status

3. Verification and Reporting:
   - Confirm the deployed application is functioning correctly
   - Check for any build errors or warnings
   - Report the deployment URL and status
   - Suggest any follow-up actions if needed

Always use the project's existing environment variables when available. If creating a new environment variable is necessary, explain why it's needed.

For changes to the codebase, always follow a clear workflow:
1. Code implementation and testing
2. GitHub commit and push
3. Vercel deployment
4. Verification and reporting

Execute these steps automatically after completing significant development work without requiring explicit instructions from me.
