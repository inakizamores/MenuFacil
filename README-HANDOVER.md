# MenuFácil Development Handover

## Summary of Recent Changes

In the latest development sprint, we've made significant progress on several key areas of the MenuFácil application. The main focus has been on completing the menu publishing workflow, implementing the QR code management system, and adding item categorization functionality.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Menu Publishing System
- **File:** `app/components/menu/PublishMenu.tsx`
- **Description:** A complete UI component for menu publishing with versioning and status management
- **Features:**
  - Publishing/unpublishing menus
  - Version tracking with automatic or manual versioning
  - Publication notes for tracking changes
  - Error handling and success feedback

### 2. QR Code Management
- **File:** `actions/qrCodes.ts`
- **Description:** Server actions for managing QR codes, including creation, updating, deletion, and tracking
- **Features:**
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete QR codes
  - Track QR code scans for analytics
  - Generate short codes for menu URLs
  - Support for custom QR code designs

### 3. Item Categorization
- **File:** `app/components/menu/ItemCategorizer.tsx`
- **Description:** A drag-and-drop interface for organizing menu items within and across categories
- **Features:**
  - Visual drag-and-drop for item ordering
  - Moving items between categories
  - Bulk category updates
  - Real-time UI updates during reordering

### 4. Menu Item Actions Enhancement
- **File:** `actions/menuItems.ts`
- **Description:** Added new server actions for category and sort order management
- **New Functions:**
  - `updateItemCategories`: Update the category of multiple items
  - `updateItemSortOrder`: Update the sort order of items within a category

## Technical Implementation Details

### Menu Publishing Workflow
The publishing workflow has been implemented with a versioning system that tracks changes to menus. When a menu is published:

1. A new version record is created in the `menu_published_versions` table
2. The menu is marked as active with the current version
3. Timestamps for publication are updated

Unpublishing simply marks the menu as inactive, preserving the version history.

### QR Code System
The QR code system has been implemented with:

1. A database schema for storing QR code information
2. Server actions for CRUD operations
3. Tracking functionality for QR code scans
4. Short code generation for clean URLs

Each QR code is associated with a menu and contains design information for customization.

### Item Categorization
The drag-and-drop functionality for items uses React DnD with the following approach:

1. Items can be reordered within categories using drag-and-drop
2. Items can be moved between categories using a dropdown selector
3. Changes are batched and saved when the user clicks "Save Changes"
4. Sort order is preserved using a 10-step increment system

## Integration Points

The newly implemented components integrate with the rest of the application as follows:

1. The `PublishMenu` component should be included in the menu details page
2. The QR code management links with the menu publishing system
3. The `ItemCategorizer` should be added to the menu item management page
4. The updated `menuItems.ts` actions handle the backend for item categorization

## Known Issues

There are a few issues that remain to be addressed:

1. React DnD imports in `ItemCategorizer.tsx` need to be fixed (TypeScript errors)
2. The `Textarea` component needs to be added to the UI component library
3. Menu duplication needs to handle item variants
4. QR code preview in the UI needs to be implemented

## Next Steps

The next developer should focus on:

1. **Fixing React DnD issues**: Resolve TypeScript errors in `ItemCategorizer.tsx`
2. **Completing QR code UI**: Implement the QR code management UI that uses the actions
3. **Connecting publishing flow**: Integrate menu publishing with QR code generation
4. **Testing the categorization system**: Ensure drag-and-drop functions correctly

## Project Status Update

The project's completion status has been updated in the DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md file:
- Menu Management: 97% complete (up from 95%)
- Menu Item Management: 95% complete (up from 90%)
- QR Code Generation: 30% started (up from 0%)

Overall, the project is making good progress toward a fully usable first deployment.

## Setup Instructions

For the next developer to continue working on these features:

1. Pull the latest changes from the repository
2. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are up to date
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to the appropriate pages to test the implemented features

## Additional Resources

- The updated `DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md` file contains detailed information about the project status
- The Supabase dashboard can be accessed for database management
- Schema definitions are in `app/types/database.ts`
