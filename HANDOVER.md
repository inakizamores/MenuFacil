# MenuFácil Project Handover

## Recent Changes & Feature Development

### Menu Publishing System

We've implemented a comprehensive menu publishing system to allow restaurant owners to control the visibility of their menus to the public.

#### Key Components:

1. **`PublishMenu` Component** (`app/components/menu/PublishMenu.tsx`)
   - Toggle switch UI for publishing/unpublishing menus
   - Clear visual feedback with error and success notifications
   - "Last published" timestamp display
   - Button to view the published menu when active
   - Accessibility and i18n ready

2. **UI Components**
   - Added `Switch` component (`components/ui/Switch.tsx`) using Radix UI
   - Added `Breadcrumb` component (`components/ui/Breadcrumb.tsx`) for navigation
   - Both components have accessibility attributes and comprehensive documentation

3. **Server Actions**
   - Enhanced `publishMenu` and `unpublishMenu` in `actions/menus.ts`
   - Implemented proper error handling and caching strategies
   - Added cache revalidation with Next.js

4. **Publishing Management Page**
   - Created dedicated page at `app/(routes)/dashboard/restaurants/[restaurantId]/menus/[menuId]/publish/page.tsx`
   - Includes helpful publishing tips and information
   - Breadcrumb navigation for better UX

### Code Structure & Organization

Our code follows these principles:
- Client components are prefixed with 'use client'
- Props and return types are properly documented
- Component directories are organized by functionality
- UI components are in `components/ui/`
- Feature-specific components are in `app/components/<feature>/`
- Server actions are in the `actions/` directory

### Documentation

We've added comprehensive JSDoc documentation to:
- All new components
- All new server actions
- All props and interfaces

### Dependencies Added

- `@radix-ui/react-switch`: For the toggle component (v1.0.3)
- `lucide-react`: For UI icons

## Next Development Tasks

According to our development roadmap:

1. **Implement Client-Side Validation**
   - Formik or React Hook Form implementation
   - Zod schema validation for form inputs
   - Consistent error message styling

2. **Medium-term Goals**
   - Refactor authentication to use a single, consistent implementation
   - Implement image optimization for menu item uploads
   - Add multi-language menu support

## Technical Notes & Issues

1. **Type Issues**
   - Some TypeScript inconsistencies exist between server actions and components
   - The `createServerClient` function could use better typing

2. **Known Issues**
   - Menu publication doesn't yet handle image optimization
   - The Breadcrumb component has an import issue that needs fixing
   - TypeScript is reporting errors for some valid code paths

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Consider adding SWR or React Query for data fetching
   - Optimize component re-renders in the publishing workflow

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Analytics for Published Menus**
   - Track views and interactions with published menus
   - Provide restaurant owners with insights

2. **Publication Scheduling**
   - Allow owners to schedule menu publication for future dates
   - Support for seasonal or time-limited menus

3. **Menu Version Comparison**
   - Visual diff tool to compare menu versions
   - Ability to revert to previous published versions
