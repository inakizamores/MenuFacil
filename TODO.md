## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Implement analytics export functionality
- Add more customization options for QR codes
- Create a mobile app version
- Add integration with popular POS systems
- Implement inventory management features

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Implement analytics dashboard with data visualization
- ✅ Set up tracking for QR code scans and menu views
- ✅ Fix import paths to ensure build stability
- ✅ Implement QR code batch generation functionality
- ✅ Set up proper authentication with Supabase
- ✅ Implement drag-and-drop for menu item categorization
- ✅ Create form validation system with Zod
- ✅ Implement Zod validation for menu management forms

## Notes for Next Developer

- The analytics dashboard is implemented but still has import path issues
- The BatchQRGenerator component has been fixed and integrated with analytics tracking
- All critical errors have been addressed, but warnings should be addressed incrementally
- The application is deployed at: https://menufacil-nx43dfrv0-inakizamores-projects.vercel.app
- Check CHANGES.md for details on recent modifications
- Check DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md for the overall project status
- The form validation using Zod is now implemented for all authentication-related forms and menu management forms. This provides a solid foundation for implementing validation on the remaining forms in the application.
- The next focus should be on completing the validation for menu item forms, which is critical to the core functionality of the application.
