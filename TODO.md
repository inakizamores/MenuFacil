   - Create a more visually appealing layout for menu categories and items
   - Implement a way for users to filter menu items (e.g., by dietary restrictions)

2. **Finalize Form Validation**
   - Apply Zod validation to all remaining forms (login, registration, menu creation)
   - Create reusable form components for complex data types
   - Add inline validation with clear error messages
   - Ensure all forms are accessible and keyboard navigable

3. **Address Technical Debt**
   - Resolve punycode deprecation warnings
   - Replace deprecated dependencies with modern alternatives
   - Optimize image loading and processing
   - Implement more comprehensive error handling for edge cases

4. **Prepare for Production Deployment**
   - Set up proper environment configuration for production
   - Configure proper CORS settings for all API routes
   - Implement comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Create a deployment checklist with verification steps

5. **Testing Strategy**
   - Implement unit tests for critical components and utilities
   - Set up end-to-end testing for critical user flows
   - Create a testing strategy document for future development

## Suggested Workflow

1. Focus on enhancing the public menu viewing experience first, as this is the core value proposition for restaurant customers
2. Address any critical bugs or issues with the analytics dashboard
3. Implement form validation improvements
4. Address technical debt items
5. Set up testing and prepare for production deployment

## Completed Tasks
- ✅ Implement analytics dashboard with data visualization
- ✅ Set up tracking for QR code scans and menu views
- ✅ Fix import paths to ensure build stability
- ✅ Implement QR code batch generation functionality
- ✅ Set up proper authentication with Supabase
