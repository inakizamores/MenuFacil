# MenuFÃ¡cil TODO List

## Priority Tasks

### 1. Code Quality Improvements
- [ ] Address remaining ESLint warnings:
  - [ ] Replace `any` types with proper TypeScript types
  - [ ] Fix unused variables warnings by either using or removing them
  - [ ] Replace `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` components for better performance
  - [ ] Add missing React dependency arrays in useEffect hooks

### 2. Feature Development (Based on Development Progress Document)
- [ ] Continue implementing remaining features as outlined in DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md
- [ ] Focus on features marked as "In Progress" in the development roadmap
- [ ] Update progress tracking as features are completed

### 3. Testing Implementation
- [ ] Implement unit tests for critical business logic
- [ ] Add integration tests for key user flows
- [ ] Consider setting up CI/CD pipeline with testing

### 4. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize image loading and processing
- [ ] Implement proper data caching strategies
- [ ] Add lazy loading for non-critical components

### 5. Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Create component documentation
- [ ] Update development guide for new contributors

## Suggested Workflow

1. Start by fixing the most critical ESLint warnings
2. Follow with implementing or enhancing high-priority features
3. Add tests as you implement new features
4. Regularly update documentation to reflect changes
5. Make incremental commits with clear, descriptive messages

## Notes for Next Developer

- The codebase now has ESLint properly integrated - use it to maintain code quality
- All critical errors have been addressed, but warnings should be addressed incrementally
- The application is deployed at: https://menufacil-nx43dfrv0-inakizamores-projects.vercel.app
- Check CHANGES.md for details on recent modifications
- Check DEVELOPMENT_PROGRESS.md for the overall project status
