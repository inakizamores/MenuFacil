# Deployment Fix: Browserbase SDK

## Issue Fixed (March 20, 2024)

Fixed a build error that was preventing successful deployment. The error was:

```
Failed to compile.
./mcp-servers/browserbase/src/index.ts:16:29
Type error: Cannot find module '@browserbasehq/sdk' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

## Solution

Added the missing `@browserbasehq/sdk` dependency to the project:

```bash
npm install @browserbasehq/sdk --save
```

This resolved the TypeScript error during build related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration.

## Deployment Notes

- The fix has been tested locally and committed to the repository
- All other MCP server dependencies should be properly installed
- This fixes the Vercel deployment error shown in the build logs

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor the deployment** to ensure no other dependency issues arise
2. **Review other MCP server implementations** to ensure all required dependencies are properly included
3. **Consider adding dependency checks** to the CI/CD pipeline to catch these issues earlier
